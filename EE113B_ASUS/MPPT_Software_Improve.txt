Improving the tracking efficiency:

Software:

1. Precision of D: more precise when approaching MPPT:

2. Give more response time for sensing when approaching MPPT (Dealy_US)

3. Calculate the avg of Pout when approaching MPPT

4. (might not be useful) Use integration controlling method

Hardware: 

1. Choose switches with low Rds,on (As long as the voltage spikes not exceeding the max ratings (leave at least 25%-50% space for spikes))

2. Thermal management Rds,on, Coss... (strongly correlated to deadtime -> Pov)

3. Gate drive losses [have not calculated]

3. Qrr (reverse recovery) & Coss [comparatively small]

4. AC loss <-> winding loss [Inductor]

5. LDO and 1.25V regulators -- unavoidable
