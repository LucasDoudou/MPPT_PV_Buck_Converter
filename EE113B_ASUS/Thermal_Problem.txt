Check-off:
(a) Describe how your efficiency measurements compare to efficiencies you expect for each operating point; 
(b) Describe likely source(s) of any discrepancies, including which losses you have observed to be higher than predicted and how you know; 
(c) Discuss your ideas for improving these losses and/or improving your
calculations to account for them. Then, tell us 
(d) how much dedicated time you spent on this lab, and 
(e) if any other student(s) in the lab helped you, and who.

a) Efficiency in simulation (nominal): 98.95%; by hand calculation: 97.5%

Hand calculation:
P_cond = I^2*Rds_on = 1.67W
P_ov = 1/2*Vin*IL*tov*fsw = 0.1167W
P_coss = Ceq,Q*Vin^2 = 0.0173w
P_gate = 1/2*Cg*Vdrive^2*f = 0.67W   = 1/2*QG*Vdrive*f

Without considering:
Core loss(ac loss) + Inductor_ESR(winding loss) + loss of efficiency due to ripples

Thermal problems (Rds_on, Ceq,Q, Cg increase) -> leads to the power loss

b) Inductor winding loss + core loss(f high); Cap ESR,(paralleled resistance), ESL; 
with thermal management worsens(density),[MOSFET] Rds_on increases, Coss increases; 
overlap losses?

In PCB design: power stage resistance large? Parasitic resistances of MOS

c) For my poor thermal management, which is basically because of the density and inappropriate placement of MOS and heat sink; For the efficiency not as expected, mainly because of my inductance and capacitance are far more than the minimum values (and thermal problems)
